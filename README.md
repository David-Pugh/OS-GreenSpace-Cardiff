# OS-GreenSpace-Cardiff
Experimenting with the OS Greenspace maps.

You can explore the OS Greenspace maps in your browser at https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getoutside/greenspaces/ - a great way to see what open and green spaces are nearby and how you could create routes between them. 

In this code I play with the using the shapefiles from OS Greenspaces and overlaying them on geotiles to create my own bespoke maps using R.

Access to the shapefiles s via OS at https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-open-greenspace.html
