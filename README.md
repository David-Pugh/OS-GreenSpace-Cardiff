# OS-GreenSpace-Cardiff
Experimenting with the OS Greenspace maps.

You can explore the [OS](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/) Greenspace maps in your browser at https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getoutside/greenspaces/ - a great way to see what open and green spaces are nearby and how you could create routes between them. 

In this code I play with the using the shapefiles from OS Greenspaces; overlaying them on geotiles to create my own bespoke maps using R, as well as interactive browser maps using Python and [Folium](https://folium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)/Leaflet.js. 

Access to the shapefiles is via OS at https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-open-greenspace.html
